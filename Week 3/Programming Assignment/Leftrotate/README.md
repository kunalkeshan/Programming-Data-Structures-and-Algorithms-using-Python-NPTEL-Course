# Left rotate

A square n√ón matrix of integers can be written in Python as a list with n elements, where each element is in turn a list of n integers, representing a row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix

  1  2  3
  4  5  6
  7  8  9
would be represented as [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]].

Write a function leftrotate(m) that takes a list representation m of a square matrix as input, and returns the matrix obtained by rotating the original matrix counterclockwize by 90 degrees. For instance, if we rotate the matrix above, we get

  3  6  9
  2  5  8    
  1  4  7
Your function should not modify the argument m provided to the function rotate().

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

```py
leftrotate([[1,2],[3,4]])
# [[2, 4], [1, 3]]

leftrotate([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
# [[3, 6, 9], [2, 5, 8], [1, 4, 7]]

leftrotate([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]])
# [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```
