# Contracting

Write a function contracting(l) that takes as input a list of integer l and returns True if the absolute difference between each adjacent pair of elements strictly decreases.

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

```py
contracting([9,2,7,3,1])
# True

contracting([-2,3,7,2,-1])
# False

contracting([10,7,4,1])
# False
```
